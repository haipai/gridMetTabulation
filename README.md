# gridMetTabulation
This repository is about tabulate several weather variables by various spatial units, like county, HUC8/12 based on gridMet data set.

Main Data Sources
1. (GridMet) http://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html
2. Census bureau county shape files. 

Main Arcgis Maps
1. gridMet_albers: polygon features mimic the grid points implied by GridMet netcdf lon/lat points with "USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic_USGS_version" equal area projection. 
2. cb_2019_us48_county_5m_albers: polygon features clipped and re-projected from cb_2019_us_county_5m.shp (Link Needed)

Main Matching Tables 
1. tabu_fips_gridmet: a table generated by Analysis Tools\Statistics\tabulate intersection function with gridMet_albers and  cb_2019_us48_county_5m_albers. The area unit is square kilometers. 
2. tabu_huc8_gridmet: (in processing) 

Mapmaking Process
1. Gridmet 
   technical route: raster file -> shape file -> reproject
   software: arcgis 10.8 
   
2. County Maps
   technical route: original map -> clip -> reproject 
   software: arcgis 10.8 
   
3. HUC8 Maps 
   technical route: original map -> clip -> reproject 
   software: arcgis 10.8 
   note: some HUC8 will have some parts outside of USA, e.g., northern huc8 region may include some Canada regions. When tabulating    weather variables, these areas outside of USA will not be counted. 
   
R scripts:
